# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Samsung-Analysis

 Three files are included:

 * R Script
 * Tidy Data Set
 * Explanatory Codebook

## R Script

 The R Script, run_analysis.R, extracts and manipulates the Samsung data to create a tidy data table that includes the average mean and standard deviation for all activities for each subject. 

## Tidy Data Set

 The R script concludes by writing a tidy data table. 
 To generate the table, run: 

 read.table("tidy.txt")

 What makes the data set tidy is that each observation contains the average values of each of six activities for each subject.

## Explanatory Codebook

 The Codebook explains the processes carried out by the run_analysis.R script and gives a brief definition of all variables.
